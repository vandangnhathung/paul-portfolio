# My books

I use Goodreads to track my reading. This page shows books imported from my Goodreads account.
My favorite genre lately has been history and memoirs - real people's experiences fascinate me.
When it comes to movies, though, I lean toward sci-fi. I also write book reviews from time to time.

If you're on Goodreads too, let's connect! You can find my profile at https://www.goodreads.com/phucbm
