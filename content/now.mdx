# Now

Following [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff)' concept, this [now page](https://nownownow.com/p/TXn6) shares what's keeping me busy right now.

---

Building [ui/phucbm](https://ui.phucbm.com/) - a React component library with a GSAP-first approach, featuring the components I use most often.

Exploring the Next.js + WordPress (as headless CMS) stack to find the sweet spot for modern web development.

Just launched [tich.vn](https://tich.vn/) - a platform to help you pick the right card for every purchase and go cashless with confidence.
