description: 2025 Next.js MDX Edition - Less maintaining, more writing
---

Took me less than a week to deploy this new version of my blog. If you're interested in the technologies behind this blog, or planning
to craft your own blog. This post hopefully be quite helpful!

    This tech stack give me the precious time to focus on writing, other than maintaining the code.

## The stack
This blog is relied solely on Next.js with MDX supported from Nextra.

- **Next.js** v16.0.1
- **React** v19.2.0
- **Nextra** v4.6.0
- **TailwindCSS** v4.1.16
- **PageFind** v1.4.0

The previous versions of my website were created with WordPress framework which costed quite a lot of effort to maintain.
Then I switch to a much more simpler - Jekyll and deployed as a static site on GitHub Pages. But that was just so limited as Jekyll using pure markdown,
while I wanted to have the ability to create interactive elements right inside my post. After a few years of abandon, I get to know Nextra.

I have been using Nextra to create an internal documentation site for my team. My mind was kind of exploded the moment I know react component can live
inside a MD file. That's when I know this is when I can rebuild my blog.

## The CMS

There's actually no CMS, or the real CMS.
If there are no new component needed in a post,
I can just open my GitHub repo and write directly there with all editor support for markdown available.
In this case, GitHub can be considered as a CMS itself.

All the content on this site are written in MDX files.
If you’re not familiar with MDX, it’s a combination of Markdown and JSX. And in order to have MDX rendered on the site with either basic
elements like button, link, image, table, etc, and custom react component, you would need `@next/mdx` and [some setup steps](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/mdx).
I did not go through the MDX setup in Next.js - thanks to Nextra, I can skip those time consuming tasks and dive right into structuring and styling my blog.

## The styling

I use TailwindCSS for this site as all of my components are using it.
